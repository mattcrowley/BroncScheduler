# BroncScheduler
College Senior Project, a scheduling system created using Qt

Features:
- Crawled the public URL for my school to build lists of class info to help a user generate a schedule.
  - As a result of this, when my school moved their class list to a private location, this program stopped working.
- Allowed the user to block off days they didn't want classes, and print their schedules to PDFs.
