# BroncScheduler
- College Senior Project, a scheduling system created using Qt

 
# Pre-requisites
- Ensure you have MCVC2015 64bit set as the project compiler. 
- Ensure you have QTWebEngine installed in your Qt installation.
- This was tested using Qt 5.10.1, any future versions might not work.

 
# Features
- Crawled the public URL for my school to build lists of class info to help a user generate a schedule.
  - As a result of this, when my school moved their class list to a private location, this program stopped working.
- Allowed the user to block off days they didn't want classes, and print their schedules to PDFs.
